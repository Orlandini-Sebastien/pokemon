# Pokédex Update

Welcome to the latest version of my Pokédex project! I’m excited to share all the new features and improvements I’ve added. 🐾❗️

## Overview

I had a blast working on the first page, where a playful Pikachu is always chasing after an elusive Mewtwo. ⚡️🐭⚡️ This project was a fantastic opportunity to expand my front-end development skills, and I’ve made some significant updates that I think you’ll enjoy.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Button Video
🎥 The button leading to the Pokédex now features a video that activates each time the theme switches between dark and light mode, adding an interactive touch to the user experience.

### Three.js Pokéball Animation
⚾️ The Pokéball animation is crafted using Three.js, bringing the site to life with a realistic, dynamic effect.

### Framer Motion Animations
🛠️ The entire site utilizes Framer Motion for smooth, visually appealing transitions, making the user experience more engaging.

### Revamped Pokémon Cards
🗃️ I’ve completely redesigned the Pokémon cards. Now, larger-than-life Pokémon leap out of the card with a trendy "out of the box" effect, making each card feel unique and exciting.

### Interactive Card Flip
🔁 I’ve added a flip feature to the Pokémon cards, allowing users to switch between general information and stats. This gives each card a dynamic, rotating reveal, adding depth to the interaction.

### Infinite Scroll & Search
🛠️ The project includes an infinite scroll feature for seamless navigation, along with a search function by ID, making it easier to find your favorite Pokémon.

### Gradient-Based Pokémon Types
🎆 Each Pokémon card now showcases a gradient based on its type, with animated characteristics. The cards are also styled differently for light and dark modes, enhancing the visual experience across themes. 🌞✨🌛
